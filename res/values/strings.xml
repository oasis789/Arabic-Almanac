        Instead of having to carry around a bulky dictionary (believe me, I\'ve been there), you can now
        access the same information at the luxury of your fingertips.
        \n
        \nYou can search for the roots of a word either using by an Arabic keyboard or by using 
        roman (english) letters in case you don\'t have an Arabic keyboard. The letters are 
        replaced according to the following table:
        \n\nDouble letters:\n
		\t th/v/V = "ث" \t\t gh/g/G = "غ"\n
		\t kh/x/X = "خ" \t\t sh/$ = "ش"\n
		\t dh = "ذ" \n
		\n
		Different cases:\n
		\t d = "د" \t\t  t = "ت"\n
		\t D = "ض"\t T = "ط"\n
		\t z = "ز" \t\t  h = "ه"\n
		\t Z = "ظ" \t H = "ح"\n
		\t s = "س" \n
		\t S = "ص" \n
		\n
		All other "normal" letters:\n
		\t a/A = "ا" \t\t q/Q   = "ق"\n
		\t b/B = "ب" \t k/K   = "ك"\n
		\t j/J = "ج" \t\t l/L   = "ل"\n
		\t No.7 = "ح"  m/M = "م"\n
		\t r/R = "ر" \t\t n/N   = "ن"\n
		\t w/W = "و" \t y/Y   = "ي"\n
		\t f/F = "ف" \t e/E/3 = "ع"\n
		\nPlease remember this developer in your duaas!!</string>
